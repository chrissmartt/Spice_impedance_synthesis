# Control process for calculating equivalent circuit models which reproduce
# frequency domain transfer functions provided as tabulated data: frequency Re{H} Im{H}
#
# The process is as follows:
# 1. Vfit: Fit a pole-zero filter function to the complex data using
#                        the vector fitting process
# 2. ../bin/network_synthesis: Create a passive circuit model whose impedance is the transfer function provided.
#                               The circuit model is provided as a Spice sub-circuit
# 3. Run Spice to calculate the impedance of the circuit model for comparison with the input data
# 4. Plot the comparison data

# Check that we have both a name and a model order (2 parameters)
if [ "$#" = "2" ] ; then
